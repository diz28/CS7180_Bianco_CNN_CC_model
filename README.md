# CS7180_Bianco_CNN_CC_model

### Late Days used - 3 Days 

### OS Used
We mainly used `jupyter notebook` on macOS to implement the model.

### Execution
We used the packages mentioned below for our implementation. All our code is in our jupyter notebook organized into modular sections. Paths need to be changed accordingly to point the code to the dataset locations. The code also has a results section that will display the original image, ground truth and model result.

As mentioned in the report this is an implementation of [Biance et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04548.pdf) "Color constancy using CNNs" paper.

The datasets used are Nikon D40 and Nikon D5200 from ["Illuminant Estimation for Color Constancy" by Cheng et al](https://cvil.eecs.yorku.ca/projects/public_html/illuminant/illuminant.html#NikonD5200).
